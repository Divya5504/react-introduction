Note that, we only need to add the exact prop for the Home component route and there is no need of adding that prop to other routes in this case.
Now, let's add the route for /contact page.

const App = () => {
  return (

      <Route path="/" component={Home} exact={true} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

Here's a demo:
