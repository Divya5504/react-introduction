Setting up project
React Router Introduction / Let's begin
Let's create a React application using create-react-app so we can start using the react-router-dom library.

Create a new React application by executing the following command from the terminal:

npx create-react-app react-router-basics

Here, npx command allows us to execute the create-react-app command without installing the create-react-app npm package on our local machine.

react-router-basics is the name we have given for our React application. You can choose the name as per your choice.

Once the application is created, delete all files from the src folder and create index.js and styles.css files inside the src folder.

Install the react-router-dom library from npm repository from inside the react-router-basics folder:

npm install react-router-dom

Open the index.js file and add the following contents inside it:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Introduction to Routing</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

Now, start the React application by executing the npm start command from the project directory (react-router-basics).

You will see the following screen If you navigate to http://localhost:3000/ URL.
