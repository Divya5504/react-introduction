When we use the Link component, Redirect component or history.push method to redirect the user to a different route, we may need to pass additional information while redirecting.

In this section, we will see how to achieve that.

Normally we use the Link component from react-router-dom as shown below:

<Link to="/register">Register</Link>

So when we click on the Register link in the navigation menu, it will redirect to the /register route, but Link also allows us to pass additional data while redirecting. 

Here's how we can do that:

<Link to={{ 
 pathname: "/register", 
 state: data_you_need_to_pass 
}}>
 Register
</Link>

Here, at the place of data_you_need_to_pass, we can pass a string or object, array etc. and for the pathname we provide the route to be redirected to.

And in the component linked to the /register route, we will get the passed data in props.location.state.

Here's a Code Sandbox demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/pass-data-routing-link-forked-6eo0i?file=/src/components/UserForm.js

Here, inside the UserForm.js file, for the Register button, we're passing all the user entered details to the /details route as shown below:

<Link
  className="btn btn-primary"
  to={{
    pathname: "/details",
    state: this.state
  }}
>
  Register
</Link>

and in the Details.js file which is the component linked to the /details route, we're accessing the passed state information using props.location.state.
