As you have seen in the previous module, the page is completely refreshed when clicked on any of the navigation links so it's not using client-side routing yet.

This is because we're using anchor tag (<a />) for navigation links.

React router provides a Link component to fix this.

Open components/Header.js file and import Link at the top of the file like this:

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

The Link component accepts a to prop where we specify the path like this:

<Link to="/">Home</Link>

So make this change for all of the links in the Header.js file.

Your changed Header.js file will look like this:

import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <ul className="navigation-menu">
      <li>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
      </li>
    </ul>
  );
};

export default Header;

If you check the application now, you will see that, there is no page refresh happening while using the navigation.
Here's a Code Sandbox demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/condescending-feynman-juto6?file=/src/components/Header.js

This looks more natural now and we get an instant response without a flash of the screen.

The Link component uses HTML5 history API to achieve the client-side routing functionality without a page refresh.

So you get an instant response and is the preferred way to do client-side routing.
