To use the react-router-dom library we need to provide a separate route for each component.

So If we have a /about page then we will display the About component and for /contact page, we will display the Contact component.

Let's create Home, About and Contact as functional components inside the index.js file.

const Home = () => {
  return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
};

const About = () => {
  return <h2>About Page</h2>;
};

const Contact = () => {
  return <h2>Contact Page</h2>;
};

Here, we're using arrow function syntax for writing components, so If you're not familiar with it, check out my this article to understand it better.

To implement routing, react-router-dom provides BrowserRouter and Route components.

Import them at the top of the index.js file like this:

import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

Now, create an App component inside the index.js file where we'll define our routes.

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
    
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};;

We need to define all our routes inside the BrowserRouter component.

So let's create a route for the home page to display our previously created Home component.

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Route path="/" component={Home} />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

The Route component accepts the path and component as the props.

For the path, we provided / because we want to display the Home component on our home page.

Now, for the ReactDOM.render method pass App as the component instead of the previously added h1 tag.

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
Your entire index.js will look like this now:

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter, Route } from "react-router-dom";

const Home = () => {
  return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
};

const About = () => {
  return <h2>About Page</h2>;
};

const Contact = () => {
  return <h2>Contact Page</h2>;
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Route path="/" component={Home} />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

Now, If you access the application at http://localhost:3000/, you will see the Home Page text displayed which is coming from our Home component.
