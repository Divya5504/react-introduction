As you can see, we get Home and About components content getting displayed instead of just About component content when we access /about page.

This is because when we provide a path prop to the Route, it matches the start of the path so both the / and /about starts with / therefore, the content of both of the components gets displayed.

To fix this, we need to pass an additional exact prop to the Route component.

The exact is a boolean prop so when we provide exact={true} as a prop to the Route component, it will display that component of the Route, only when the path matches exactly.

So let's add the exact prop to the first route which is for the Home component.

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Route path="/" component={Home} exact={true} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

Now, If you check the application, you will see that the /about page is correctly displaying contents of only the About component.
